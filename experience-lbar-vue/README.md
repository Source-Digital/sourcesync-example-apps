<!-- # Content SDK Example with Vue.js and TypeScript

This is an example project of how to use the SourceSync SDK's Content Library with Vue.js and TypeScript.

## Project setup

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

For the initial setup, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
VITE_SOURCESYNC_APP_KEY=your-app-key 
VITE_SOURCESYNC_APP_ENV=dev
```

For convenience, you can copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
You can also name the file as `.env.local` if you intend to use it only for local development. The file will be ignored by git.

## Running the project

To run the project, run the following command:
```bash

npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you can access the project at `http://localhost:5143` or any other port that is displayed in the terminal.
